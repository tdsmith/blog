<p>Together with some friends from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/121005897942196/">Taco Tuesday Social Ride</a>&nbsp;(we bike to taco places around Irvine on Tuesdays; you're invited), I'm planning a bike trip from Irvine to San Diego for late September. I don't think any of us have gone that far (~90 miles) in a single day before, so we're doing some training now to get our mileage counts up.</p>
<p>Today, we did a ride down Santiago Canyon Road in the foothills to the east. At 46 miles with a 1/2 mile of climb in full sun, it was a pretty good trip!</p>
<p>For the curious or adventurous, you can find an <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/kumokasumi/activity/105302868">overview map</a> and a <a href="http://blog.tim-smith.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Santiago-Canyon.xlsx">route card</a>. We were hoping the Irvine part of the Peters Canyon Trail would be re-opened, but it was still closed east of Warner, so we detoured south to Harvard and continued until we met the trail past Walnut.</p>
