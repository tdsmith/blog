<p>I'm curious about nutrition.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://rd.io/i/QVlL5DdBwLc/?source=oembed" frameborder="0" width="390" height="80"></iframe></p>
<p>What do you eat? It's a fraught question. My own friends run the gamut from militant carnivores to careful locavore vegans; some have strictly regimented diets and others make food strictly an afterthought. What you eat reflects your values and affects your health. Feelings about food run deep.&nbsp;So it's not surprising that there's a lot of conventional wisdom about nutrition -- or that a lot of it is contradictory.</p>
<p>It's hard to know who to trust. A lot of "experts" consulted by the popular press seem to base their advice more on intuition and fads than on any kind of empirical data. To be sure, a lot of these things are hard to study, for reasons that I hope to address in a future post. But the scientific and medical communities have built up a lot of solid research over the years that can answer a lot of questions and I'm curious to see what it can teach me.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in challenging my own assumptions.&nbsp;I have no particular qualification to talk about nutrition or health -- I want to use this series as a tool to develop my own understanding. My goals for this series are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn how my diet can help me avoid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer</li>
<li>learn what I need to be doing in order to maintain a healthy weight, and</li>
<li>to learn more about metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and interventions for them</li><br />
</ul><br />
by surveying the published literature. I'll see you back here soon!</p>
