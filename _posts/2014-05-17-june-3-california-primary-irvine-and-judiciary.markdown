<p>Finally to the end of the ballot!</p>
<p>There's only one race in Irvine, for a short-term seat on the Irvine Unified School District board.</p>
<p>There's a few judiciary elections. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-levinson-end-judicial-elections-20140509-story.html">Judiciary elections are dumb</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>A Southern California judge is being publicly admonished for saying a rape victim "didn't put up a fight" during her assault and that if someone doesn't want sexual intercourse, the body "will not permit that to happen."</p>
<p>Johnson made the comments in the case of a man who threatened to mutilate the face and genitals of his ex-girlfriend with a heated screwdriver, beat her with a metal baton and made other violent threats before committing rape, forced oral copulation, and other crimes.</p>
<p>"I'm not a gynecologist, but I can tell you something: If someone doesn't want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down. The body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage is inflicted, and we heard nothing about that in this case," Johnson said.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>That's an argument we don't need our judiciary making. Please vote for <a href="http://www.haydenforjudge.com/">Helen Hayden</a> for Superior Court Office 20.</p>
<h2>IUSD Governing Board</h2></p>
<p>This is a special election race on the primary ballot, not a primary election. Candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>teacher <a href="http://www.carolyninmonpov.com/">Carolyn Inmon</a>; the Agran/Krom candidate in this race, who I've been getting mail from. I'm glad I'm a likely voter in somebody's turnout model! </li>
<li>lawyer <a href="http://www.glaskyforschoolboard.com/">Ira Glasky</a>, appointed not-quite-incumbent, Republican. <a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/027e7fcd8b3d0a8a9964f63df6ccd79d?AccessKeyId=DE42A0B5CC3A6F2D3008&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1">Register endorsement</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bobvuforiusd.com/">Bob Vu</a>; describes himself as a "scientist" or "rocket scientist" and "entrepeneur" but I think clearly isn't? He has a bachelors in CS management and a night-school MBA. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2134594">LinkedIn says</a> he does project management for Raytheon and has for seven years. He also calls himself a "parent" which, I don't know, is <em>probably</em> true? Says STEM and STEAM a lot.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>These names are all familiar; Inmon and Vu were both on the ballot in 2012 and neither won election, coming in as the 1st and 2nd runner-ups for the three seats open on the board. Glasky was <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/funding-539808-school-think.html">appointed in November</a> when Gavin Huntley-Fenner stepped down but <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/election-604979-board-special.html">forced to resign</a> after Irviners gathered enough signatures to force a special election -- though not out of any particular animus, I don't think. The winner will hold the seat for five months and then we'll go through the whole charade again in November. Good work, everyone. Agran and Krom supported the special election.</p>
<p>The biggest issue before the board in the next few months will be the location of Irvine's new high school. The IUSD board <a href="http://newsflash.iusd.org/category/fifth-high-school/">has endorsed Site A</a>, near the Great Park. Inmon, Agran, and Krom are pushing <a href="http://www.irvinematters.com/wp-content/uploads/HS-Exhibit-14-0108.pdf">this absurd map</a> emphasizing how close the school is to the Musick jail (spoiler: not that close? though <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/22/local/la-me-great-park-inmates-20131223">Musick will be expanding</a>) and "toxic contamination" (spoiler: it's cleaner than the state's rigorous standards and <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/site-610163-district-school.html">Site B looks comparable</a>). "Anomaly area 3" sure sounds spooOoOooky though!</p>
<p>IUSD has their own maps; this map shows <a href="http://newsflash.iusd.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EPA-removes-nearly-2000-acres-of-El-Toro-site-from-Superfund-list.jpg">Site A and B with respect to streets and Superfund designations</a> and this map shows <a href="http://newsflash.iusd.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IUSDs-proposed-high-school-boundaries.png">the school district boundaries with the new school included</a>.</p>
<p>Site B is closer to current urban development in Irvine but neither site is presently walkable. Site A will be nestled in a housing development near a jail; I'm not sure if that should bother me. I'm not happy about the Agran/Krom "toxic waste" disinformation campaign or forcing a special election to open a seat for a five-month term to deal with a single issue. IUSD seems to be mostly concerned about making their 2016 timeline for opening the school. They're running the environmental review process for site B in parallel with site A but it's basically already complete for site A, as far as I can tell. Site B is still partially RCRA-listed as a contaminated site but I think we can expect it will be found to be clean before building commences.</p>
<p>I think we can presume that Inmon will vote for Site B and Glasky will vote for Site A. You know as much as I do; the choice is yours.</p>
<h2>Judge of the Superior Court, Office 14</h2></p>
<p>This is an open seat. Candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin Haskins, assistant DA</li>
<li>Kenneth C. "KC" Jones, deputy AG. Labor Federation endorsement.</li>
<li>Thomas E. Martin, attorney</li>
<li>Fred Fascenelli, attorney</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Greg Diamond <a href="http://www.orangejuiceblog.com/2014/05/gregs-ballot-recommendations-for-most-of-the-june-primary-races/">says</a> that Martin probably isn't really in the race. He suggests voting for Jones.</p>
<p>I don't know how I'll learn anything about these candidates, so that works for me.</p>
<h2>Judge of the Superior Court, Office 20</h2></p>
<p>Candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haydenforjudge.com/">Helen Hayden</a></li>
<li>incumbent Derek Johnson</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Discussed above; please vote for Hayden.</p>
<h2>Judge of the Superior Court, Office 27</h2></p>
<p>Candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>incumbent <a href="http://www.judgemotoike.com/">Joanne Motoike</a>. UCI alumna! <a href="http://www.rafu.com/2013/09/joanne-motoike-appointed-to-orange-county-superior-court/">Appointed by Jerry Brown last year</a> after many years as a OC public defender and service at the Hague. Registered Democrat. Backed by the establishment. OC Register endorsement.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.philips4judge.com/">Wayne Philips</a>. Website includes important footnotes "Please note: Wayne Philips is not a licensed contractor/a current member of the judiciary."</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I think incumbents should generally win in judicial elections because I don't think they should be elected positions and Motoike seems popular! Diamond calls her "[the] single most impressive candidate I&rsquo;ve seen: wonderful background, temperament, intelligence, and communication skills." Nice to have a public defender on the bench, too, I think.</p>
<h2>Judge of the Superior Court, Office 35</h2></p>
<p>Candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fergusonforjudge.org/">Jeff Ferguson</a>, deputy DA</li>
<li><a href="http://www.carmenluegeforjudge.com/">Carmen Luege</a>, Superior Court Commissioner; Register endorsement.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I'm voting for Luege because wow, look at Ferguson's glasses.</p>
<p>Kidding, probably, but Commissioner is a judicial role so Luege already has experience from the other side of the bench, and <a href="http://www.orangejuiceblog.com/2014/05/gregs-ballot-recommendations-for-most-of-the-june-primary-races/">Diamond says</a> that the judiciary supports her.</p>
